.globl f # this allows other files to find the function f

# f takes in two arguments:
# a0 is the value we want to evaluate f at
# a1 is the address of the "output" array (defined above).
# The return value should be stored in a0
f:
    # Your code here
    addi a0 a0 3    # index = x + 3. eg, the index of -3 is 0 = -3 + 3
    slli a0 a0 2       # address = index * 4
    add a1 a1 a0
    lw a0 0(a1)
    # This is how you return from a function. You'll learn more about this later.
    # This should be the last line in your program.
